# NOTE
This particular project is abandoned, and I have continued working [here](https://github.com/brimstone-/APCompSci/tree/master/Projects/TextEditorFinal).

### My Java Text Editor

My editor has basic read/write functionality.

### TODO:
	1) Add line numbering (DONE)
	2) If I have time and the will, maybe add syntax highlighting 
	  (DONE: In my redone version, as this version is old and defunct
	   The new version uses something very akin to JTextArea, but better).
