## My Java Text Editor

### Installation and use
Surprise, there's no installation! Simply download the TextEditor.jar file, or everything if you're curious, and run the TextEditor.jar file.

### Features
* Ability to Open/Save files
* Line numbering
* Some Java syntax highlighting

### Notes
This was made with the help of an extra library called the RSyntaxTextArea
made by GitHub user bobbylight.

His repository can be found [here](https://github.com/bobbylight/RSyntaxTextArea).

### TODO
* Add tab functionality, so you can edit multiple files at once!
