### Installation and use
Surprise, there's no installation! Simply download the TextEditor.jar file, or everything if you're curious, and run the TextEditor.jar file.

### Features
* Ability to Open/Save files
* Line numbering
* Some Java syntax highlighting (Toggleable)
* Tabs!

### Notes
This was made with the help of an extra library called the RSyntaxTextArea
made by GitHub user bobbylight.

His repository can be found [here](https://github.com/bobbylight/RSyntaxTextArea).

I also make consult/reference to, but don't actually end up using Apache Commons IO, another cool library

Their website is [here](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/).

### TODO
* Fix bugs if I discover them
* All done, if you have any feature requests, let me know.  I can't garuntee I'll be capable of everything you think of though.

### BUGS
* If the user makes/closes too many tabs in a short amount of time, the program can't keep up with the count and mis selects tabs and things like the "+" tab can be accidentally closed.
