### Features
* Ability to Open/Save files
* Line numbering
* Some Java syntax highlighting (Toggleable)
* Tabs!

### Notes
This was made with the help of an extra library called the RSyntaxTextArea
made by GitHub user bobbylight.

His repository can be found [here](https://github.com/bobbylight/RSyntaxTextArea).

I also used Apache Commons IO, another wonderful library

Their website is [here](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/).

### TODO
* All done, if you have any feature requests, let me know.  I can't garuntee I'll be capable of everything you think of though.
